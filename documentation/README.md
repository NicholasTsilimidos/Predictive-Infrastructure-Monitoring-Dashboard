# Documentation

This folder contains all supporting coursework and planning documents that was created throughout the semester for the project 
"Predictive Infrastructure Monitoring Dashboard Using Zabbix."

These documents show the development process of the project from planning and design to architecture and data modeling, which directly support the final implementation and report.
