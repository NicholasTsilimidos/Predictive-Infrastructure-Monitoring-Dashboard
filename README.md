Group Members - Saimanikanta Reddy, Rachael Oyenola, Nicholas Tsilimidos

2. Project Overview

Our project focuses on building a Predictive Infrastructure Monitoring Dashboard using Zabbix, an open-source monitoring platform widely used in cybersecurity, system administration, and incident response. The goal of the project is to demonstrate how early detection of performance issues such as rising CPU usage, memory saturation, disk exhaustion, or website downtime can significantly reduce system failures and improve overall reliability.

Our setup uses a Zabbix Server running on Linux inside a VirtualBox, along with monitored hosts and website checks. Through different Zabbix Agents and Web Scenarios, the system continuously collects performance metrics, visualizes them in real time, and triggers alerts whenever abnormal activity is detected on the University at Albany website. By leveraging Zabbix’s built-in trend analysis, the project highlights how predictive monitoring can help administrators identify problems before they lead to outages or any cyber-related attacks.

The main objective of this project is to build a fully functional monitoring environment accompanied by a structured dashboard, alert configurations, and data-flow documentation. This demonstrates how Zabbix can be used as a proactive monitoring solution to support uptime, operational stability, and infrastructure resilience in real-world environments.
