**Project Overview: A brief summary of your project, what it does, and the main objective.

Our project focuses on building a Predictive Infrastructure Monitoring Dashboard using Zabbix, an open-source monitoring platform widely used in cybersecurity, system administration, and incident response. The goal of the project is to demonstrate how early detection of performance issues such as rising CPU usage, memory saturation, disk exhaustion, or website downtime can significantly reduce system failures and improve overall reliability.

Our setup uses a Zabbix Server running on Linux inside a VirtualBox, along with monitored hosts and website checks. Through different Zabbix Agents and Web Scenarios, the system continuously collects performance metrics, visualizes them in real time, and triggers alerts whenever abnormal activity is detected on the University at Albany website. By leveraging Zabbix’s built-in trend analysis, the project highlights how predictive monitoring can help administrators identify problems before they lead to outages or any cyber-related attacks.

The main objective of this project is to build a fully functional monitoring environment accompanied by a structured dashboard, alert configurations, and data-flow documentation. This demonstrates how Zabbix can be used as a proactive monitoring solution to support uptime, operational stability, and infrastructure resilience in real-world environments.

**Project Relevance: Explain why this problem or tool matters in cybersecurity/forensics. Why did you choose it? What skills or knowledge can someone gain from this work?

Predictive monitoring plays a critical role in cybersecurity and digital forensics because many incidents begin with subtle anomalies long before a system fully fails. Tools like Zabbix allow people to detect early warning signs such as unexplained CPU spikes, memory exhaustion, slow website response times, unauthorized downtime, or abnormal network traffic that may indicate emerging vulnerabilities. By continuously collecting and storing system data, Zabbix supports real-time visibility as well as forensic reconstruction after an incident occurs.

We chose Zabbix for this project because it is a widely used, open-source monitoring solution that mirrors what real organizations use in system administration and cybersecurity environments. It provides hands-on exposure to concepts that cybersecurity professionals rely on daily, such as alerts, trend analysis, host monitoring, and understanding system health indicators. Monitoring the University at Albany website using a Linux host on a Virtual Machine allowed us to simulate real-world scenarios where early detection directly prevents downtime and reduces the impact of cyber-related attacks.

This project helps develop practical skills that are valuable in cybersecurity and digital forensics, including configuring monitoring agents, interpreting system metrics, detecting anomalies, and understanding service availability. These skills are essential for SOC analysts, incident responders, and forensic investigators who rely on accurate system data to identify threats, troubleshooting issues, and prevent outages. Overall, the project demonstrates how proactive monitoring strengthens system reliability, enhances visibility, and contributes to a stronger defensive posture in modern IT environments.
