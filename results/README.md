This folder contains final outputs generated from the monitoring system, including evidence of predictive monitoring in action.

- System performance logs — CPU, memory, and disk logs from Zabbix.
- Alert history — Evidence showing when and why alerts were triggered.
- Forecast graphs — Zabbix trend-based predictions for resource exhaustion.
- Final dashboard state — Summary of system health after configuration.
- Failure simulation results — Screenshots or logs from intentionally induced test scenarios.

These results are referenced in the main project README and support the conclusion that predictive monitoring reduces potential downtime.
